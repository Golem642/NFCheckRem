Ensure you have the latest Luma3DS version, then go into the folder corresponding to your console and download the .ips file.

Put this file into your SD card in the following folder : `/luma/sysmodules/`

Then, ensure you have "Enable loading external FIRMs and modules" and "Enable game patching" enabled in the Luma3DS settings (hold SELECT on boot)

You're all set ! If anything goes wrong (eg. : console crash on boot), simply delete the file and send a GitHub issue in this repository
